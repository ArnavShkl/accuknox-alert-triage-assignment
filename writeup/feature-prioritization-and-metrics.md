## Proposed Features

1. Alert prioritization using severity and confidence indicators  
2. Context-rich alert detail view with impact and exposure information  
3. Guided remediation and resolution actions  
4. Feedback mechanism to reduce false positives over time  

## Prioritization Rationale

The solution prioritizes features that reduce cognitive load and investigation time. Alert prioritization and contextual clarity deliver immediate value, while advanced analytics are intentionally excluded to keep the workflow simple and focused.

## Success Metrics

**Primary Metrics**
- Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA)  
- Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)  

**Secondary Metrics**
- Percentage of alerts marked as false positives  
- Alerts resolved per engineer per day  
- Reduction in unattended alerts
