## Problem Statement

Cloud security tools generate a large number of alerts, many of which lack sufficient context or prioritization. Security engineers spend significant time manually reviewing alerts to determine their severity, validity, and required action. This leads to alert fatigue, delayed response times, and increased risk of missing critical security incidents.

The goal of this solution is to design a clear and efficient alert triage workflow that helps security engineers quickly identify high-impact alerts, understand their context, and take appropriate action with minimal friction.
